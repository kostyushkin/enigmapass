EnigmaPass
===============

EnigmaPass is a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bgkipgfgpifliinhbnfoaafgdeemodoi) that generates secure, repeatable, per-domain, passwords based on a single master password. You only have to remember one password, but you'll get a different password for every website you visit. It builds on the great work of [SuperGenPass](http://supergenpass.com), but makes it more secure & easier to use.

When you're not able to use EnigmaPass, you can still use the tools available at [SuperGenPass](http://supergenpass.com), they will generate the same passwords.

So why use EnigmaPass? Well, being a chrome extension, EnigmaPass benefits from the enhanced security between tab and browser in Google Chrome. A website would not be able to detect any information placed in EnigmaPass, which they may be able to with EnigmaPass.
